[Shell Storm](http://shell-storm.org/) | "I'm just a guy who has a strong interest in low-level computing, program analysis and software verification methods. My "research" is mostly focused on both static and dynamic program analysis. I also enjoy doing things in various fields like: OSdev, reverse engineering, bugs exploitation and others low-level stuffs. You will find the results of my different researches on this blog."
