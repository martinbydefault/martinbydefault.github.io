## Tools

[ctf-tools & HackingTools](https://securityonline.info/ctf-tools-hackingtools-exhaustive-list-of-hacking-tools/) | Exhaustive list of hacking tools. This is a collection of setup scripts to create an install of various security research tools. Of course, this isn’t a hard problem, but it’s really nice to have them in one place that’s easily deployable to new machines and so forth.
