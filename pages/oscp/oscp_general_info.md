>The **Offensive Security Certified Professional** (OSCP) is the companion certification for our **Penetration Testing with Kali Linux** training course and is the worldâ€™s first completely hands-on offensive information security certification. The OSCP challenges the students to prove they have a clear and practical understanding of the penetration testing process and life-cycle through an arduous twenty-four (24) hour certification exam.
>
>An OSCP has demonstrated their ability to be presented with an unknown network, enumerate the targets within their scope, exploit them, and clearly document their results in a penetration test report.
