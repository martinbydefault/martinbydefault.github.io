{% include callout.html content="
The **Offensive Security Certified Professional** (OSCP) is the companion certification for our **Penetration Testing with Kali Linux** training course and is the worldâ€™s first completely hands-on offensive information security certification. The OSCP challenges the students to prove they have a clear and practical understanding of the penetration testing process and life-cycle through an arduous twenty-four (24) hour certification exam.  

An OSCP has demonstrated their ability to be presented with an unknown network, enumerate the targets within their scope, exploit them, and clearly document their results in a penetration test report.
